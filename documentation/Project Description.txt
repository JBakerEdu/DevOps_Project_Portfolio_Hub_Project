Project Overview:
	The Project Portfolio Hub is a centralized platform designed to help users manage and showcase their projects professionally and organizationally. 
		It includes various features that enhance project visibility, organization, and customization. Below is an overview of the core user stories that 
		define the system's functionality:


Centralized Project Management-
	Users can log in and access a personalized dashboard to upload, categorize, edit, delete, and reorder their projects. The system ensures project
		files are managed efficiently, preventing unsupported file types and providing confirmation messages for successful uploads.


Individual Project Pages-
	Each project has a dedicated page with a unique URL, displaying key details such as the project title, description, category, repository links, 
		and additional resources. Users can edit and update these pages and choose whether to make them public or private.


Professional Portfolio Presentation-
	Users can create a professional portfolio by customizing the layout, filtering projects by category and tags, and adding a personal profile with a 
		biography and profile picture. A preview mode allows users to see how their portfolio appears to others.


Live Project Hosting-
	Users can provide links to live versions of their projects. When a hosted project link is added, a "Live Demo" button appears on the project page, 
		allowing visitors to access the working version of the project efficiently.


Detailed Project Pages-
	Each project page includes sections for a project overview, technical details, project files, and project media.


Security & User Permissions-
	The system ensures secure project management by restricting editing rights to logged-in users while public projects remain viewable by all visitors. 
		Private projects are accessible only to their owners, and users receive email confirmations for account changes. Unauthorized users cannot 
		modify or delete projects they do not own.
